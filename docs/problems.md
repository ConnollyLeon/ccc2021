### 初级题 （示例，非最终)

1.Fast Fourier transform 

  > Fast Fourier transform is an algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence, or its inverse (IDFT). FFT rapidly computes transformations by factorizing the DFT matrix into a product of sparse (mostly zero) factors.

2.Sobel Filter
  > Sobel filter is widely used in image processing and computer vision, particularly within edge detection algorithms where it creates an image emphasising edges. Discrete differentiation operator computes an approximation of the gradient of the image intensity function.

1.Training of Random Forest Model  

  > Random forest is an ensemble learning method that consisting a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the trees.

2.Training of SVM Model
  > SVM (Support Vector Machine) is a model to predict sample’s classification. The svm_train function that trains a batch of samples using support vector machine model and output a weight vector for classification.

### 高级题3个（示例，非最终）

- Minimum Spanning Tree  
  > A minimum spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a weighted graph that connects all the vertices together. without any cycles and with the minimum possible total weight.

- K-1 Coloring
  >The K-1 Coloring algorithm assigns a color to every node in the graph, trying to optimize for two objectives:  
  > - To make sure that every neighbor of a given node has a different color than the node itself. 
  > - To use as few colors as possible.

- Estimated Diameter
  >The diameter of a graph is the greatest distance between any pair of vertices. The estimated diameter problem tries to find a distance that is close to the graph diameter as much as possible.
